# Fraud Detection
Detecting fraud for transactions in a payment gateway
A new disruptive payment gateway start-up, ‘BI Gateway’, has started gaining traction due to its extremely low processing fees for handling online vendors’ digital payments. This strategy has led to very low costs of acquiring new vendors.
Unfortunately, due to the cheap processing fees, the company was not able to build and deploy a robust and fast fraud detection system.
Consequently, a lot of the vendors have accumulated significant economic burden due to handling fraudulent transactions on their platforms. This has resulted in a significant number of current clients leaving BI Gateway’s payment gateway platform for more expensive yet reliable payment gateway companies.
The company’s data engineers curated a dataset that they believe follows the real-world distribution of transactions on their payment gateway. The company hired You and provided it with the dataset, to create a fast and robust AI based model that can detect and prevent fraudulent transactions on its payment gateway.
